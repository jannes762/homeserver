# Paperless

## Purpose

Document archiving and indexing.
Paperless is treated as an interface to the documents dataset.

## Virtualization

- LXC container

## Storage

- ZFS pool: tank
- Dataset: documents

Mounted paths:
- /data/documents → tank/documents

## Data classification

- Scanned documents
- PDFs
- Metadata generated by Paperless

All data is considered critical.

## Backups

- documents dataset included in Borg backups
- Daily snapshots enabled

## Restore strategy

In case of failure:
1. Recreate the LXC container
2. Mount the documents dataset
3. Restore dataset from Borg if needed

No application-specific restore steps are required.

## Notes

Paperless does not own the data.
It can be replaced by another document management system if needed.
