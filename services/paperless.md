# Paperless

## Purpose
Document archiving and indexing service.
Paperless is treated as an **interface layer** on top of the documents dataset.

The dataset is the single source of truth.

---

## Virtualization
- Proxmox LXC container
- Docker running inside the LXC
- Paperless-ngx deployed as Docker containers

The container is considered stateless.

---

## Storage
- ZFS pool: `tank`
- Dataset: `tank/documents`

Mounted into the container at:
- `/data/documents`

Typical substructure:
- `/data/documents/consume`
- `/data/documents/media`
- `/data/documents/export`

---

## Data Classification
- Scanned documents
- Imported PDFs
- Metadata generated by Paperless (stored alongside documents)

All data in this dataset is considered **critical**.

---

## Backups
- ZFS snapshots enabled (local, frequent)
- Dataset included in Borg offsite backups
- Borg backups executed from the Proxmox host

Retention handled by Borg policies.

---

## Restore Strategy
In case of failure:

1. Recreate the LXC container
2. Reinstall Docker and Paperless
3. Mount the `tank/documents` dataset
4. Restore dataset from Borg if required

No application-specific restore steps are required
as long as the dataset is intact.

## Notes
- Paperless does not own the data
- The documents dataset can outlive the application
- Paperless can be replaced by another document management system
  without data migration
